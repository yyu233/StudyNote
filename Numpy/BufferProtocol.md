Well, in scientific computing, most of the interesting algorithms are implemented in compiled code: for example, scipy is essentially a set of wrappers around NetLib utilities, which are well-tested implementations of scientific algorithms written mostly in Fortran and C. The ability for Python to natively share data with these compiled libraries is incredibly important for scientific computing. This is one big reason that NumPy and its predecessors were initially developed, and it's why the buffer protocol was later proposed and added to Python's standard library. The buffer protocol is extremely useful for what scientists do with Python: build intuitive interfaces to compiled legacy code.
