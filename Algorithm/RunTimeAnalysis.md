## Mathematical Analysis of Running Times
The leading coefficient depends on the compiler, JVM, machine...

* Best Case: Determined by easiest input. provide a goal for all inputs
* Worst Case: Deteermined by most difficult input. provide a guarantee for all inputs
* Average Case: Expected cost for random input. provide a way to predict performance

Develop algortim -> prove lower bound (proof that no alogrithm can do better) -> upper bound (a specific alogrithm)
