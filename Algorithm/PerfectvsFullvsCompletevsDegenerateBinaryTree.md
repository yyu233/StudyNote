A BT is perfect or height-balanced if every leaf is at the same level, which is equivalent to every path from a given node to a leaf being the same length; it is full if every internal (non-leaf) node has 2 children; it is complete if it is perfect and full; it is almost complete or nearly complete if is perfect and all levels but the last are full, and in the last level leaves are as far left as possible (so any "vacancies" are to the right); it is degenerate if every non-leaf node has just one child (and as a graph it is a path from the root to the one leaf).
