## Quick Sort
Step:
1. Find Pivot (Firts, last, random, median element)
2. Low pointer points at the first element of the remaining array, high pointer points at the last element
3. Low pointer points at a larger value than the pivot value, stops; high pointer points at at a smaller value than the pivot value; swap 
4. Repeat until low pointer and high pointer cross each other, swap the pivot with the low pointer. 
5. Divide the array into two parts from the pivot point.
6. Repeat from 1 to 5
