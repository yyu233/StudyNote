I think iteration means a lot. Iteration is a feasible action for computer to solve problem. Enssentially, it is a form that illustrates relation and pattern. 

1. By looking at the input data, can we iteratively or recursively to reach our goal? (Looks for pattern)
2. Can we use store the visited data for referencing?
3. When do we use stack? Is there any pattern implying that we want to delay some steps after some prerequisites are completed?
4. How to optimize brute force solution? Mostly brute force solution tries all combinations of possible results. Is there any repeated pattern? Can we skip some results?
