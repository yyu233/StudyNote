## Convex Hull ##

1. Smallest convex set containing all the points 
2. Smallest area convext polygon enclosing all the points

## Application ##

1. Find the shortest distance from a to b to avoid polygon obstacle
2. Find the points with largest Elucidean distance 

## Graham Scan ##

1. Choose point p with smallest y-coordinate
2. Sort points by polar angle with p
3. Consider points in order unless it creats a ccw turn.
