### Dynamic Connectivity Problem ###

The problem is defined on an undirected graph with N vertices. 
There are two operations: 1. add an edge  2. detect connectedness. 

We can partitioin the vertices into sets. Each vertice is in exactly one set. Two vertices are connected if they are in the same set.
