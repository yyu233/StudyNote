Strongly Connected

For a set of vertices S, take any 2 arbitary vertex u and v, there is always a path from u to v.

Strongly Connected Component

For a set of vertices S of strongly connected graph, add any vertex and the graph is no longer strongly connected, then S is a strongly connected component of original graph


DAG:

Transfom strongly connected component into a single point, we can get a DAG.
