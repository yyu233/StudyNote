Why array based representation for Binary Heap?    

Since a Binary Heap is a Complete Binary Tree, it can be easily represented as an array and the array-based representation is space-efficient. If the parent node is stored at index I, the left child can be calculated by 2 * I + 1 and the right child by 2 * I + 2 (assuming the indexing starts at 0).
