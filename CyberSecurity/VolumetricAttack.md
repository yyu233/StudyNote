Volumetric attacks are the most common type of DDoS attack. It simply consumes all available bandwidth between the target and the internet. This is mostly done by using botnets and directing them to a specific target.

One example of the volumetric attack could be the hacker spoofing the victim's IP and making multiple requests to an open DNS server. The attack is structured so that when DNS server responds, it sends more data to the victim than they can handle.
