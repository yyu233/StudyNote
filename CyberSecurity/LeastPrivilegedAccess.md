Least privileged access
In practice, the segregation of duties is achieved by giving each user least privileged access, meaning that every user or device within the network can access only the most essential resources they need, and nothing else. The benefit is that if that user’s credentials or device is compromised by an outside attack, a hacker would only have access to that device’s environment, and nothing more than that, which reduces the potential security risk.
