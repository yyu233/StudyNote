TCP connection attacks, otherwise known as SYN flood attacks, happen when a three-way TCP handshake between the host and the server is never completed. In this attack, the handshake is initiated, but the hacker leaves the server hanging and the ports open. This means the server cannot take any other requests. The hacker keeps flooding it with more handshakes, eventually making it crash.
