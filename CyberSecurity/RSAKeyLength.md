Different types of algorithms — particularly public key algorithms — may require different key lengths to achieve the same level of encryption strength as a symmetric-key cipher. The RSA cipher can use only a subset of all possible values for a key of a given length, due to the nature of the mathematical problem on which it is based. Other ciphers, such as those used for symmetric-key encryption, can use all possible values for a key of a given length. More possible matching options means more security.
Because it is relatively trivial to break an RSA key, an RSA public-key encryption cipher must have a very long key — at least 2048 bits — to be considered cryptographically strong. On the other hand, symmetric-key ciphers are reckoned to be equivalently strong using a much shorter key length, as little as 80 bits for most algorithms. Similarly, public-key ciphers based on the elliptic curve cryptography (ECC), such as the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) ciphers, also require less bits than RSA ciphers.
