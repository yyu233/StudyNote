Application layer or layer 7 attacks target, as the name suggests, applications – the layer where the server generates web pages and responds to HTTP requests. Such an attack would seem to the server like someone hitting refresh on the same page multiple times. It will look like legitimate traffic until the server is overflooded and it’s too late. These attacks are also less expensive and more difficult to detect than network layer attacks.
