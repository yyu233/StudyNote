LM-hashes is the oldest password storage used by Windows, dating back to OS/2 in the 1980â€™s. Due to the limited charset allowed, they are fairly easy to crack. You can obtain them, if still available, from the SAM database on a Windows system, or the NTDS database on the Domain Controller.
LM was turned off by default starting in Windows Vista/Server 2008, but might still linger in a network if there older systems are still used. It is possible to enable it in later versions through a GPO setting (even Windows 2016/10).
