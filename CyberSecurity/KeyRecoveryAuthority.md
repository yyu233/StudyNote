A key recovery authority (KRA). Certificates are created based on a specific and unique key pair. If a private key is ever lost, then the data which that key was used to access (such as encrypted emails) is also lost because it is inaccessible. The KRA stores key pairs, so that a new, identical certificate can be generated based on recovered keys, and all of the encrypted data can be accessed even after a private key is lost or damaged.
