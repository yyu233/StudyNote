DDoS attacks can target a specific component of the network connection or a mixture of them. Every connection made over the internet goes through OSI model layers. Most DDoS attacks happen in the following three layers:

Network layer (Layer 3). Attacks that are on this layer include Smurf Attacks, ICMP Floods, and IP/ICMP Fragmentation.
Transport layer (Layer 4). These attacks include SYN Floods, UDP Floods, and TCP Connection Exhaustion.
Application layer (Layer 7). Mainly, HTTP-encrypted attacks.
