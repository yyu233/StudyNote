A user can log in once, using a single password to the local client's private-key database, and get authenticated access to all SSL/TLS-enabled servers that user is authorized to use-without sending any passwords over the network. This approach simplifies access for users, because they do not need to enter passwords for each new server. It also simplifies network management, since administrators can control access by controlling lists of certificate authorities (CAs) rather than much longer lists of users and passwords.
