A token processing system (TPS). The TPS interacts directly with external tokens, like smart cards, and manages the keys and certificates on those tokens through a local client, the Enterprise Security Client (ESC). The ESC contacts the TPS when there is a token operation, and the TPS interacts with the CA, KRA, or TKS, as required, then send the information back to the token by way of the Enterprise Security Client.
