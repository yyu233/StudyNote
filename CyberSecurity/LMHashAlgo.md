1. Convert all lower case to upper case
2. Pad password to 14 characters with NULL characters
3. Split the password to two 7 character chunks
4. Create two DES keys from each 7 character chunk
5. DES encrypt the string "KGS!@#$%" with these two chunks
6. Concatenate the two DES encrypted strings. This is the LM hash.
