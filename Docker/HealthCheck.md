In a distributed system, the service availability is frequently checked by using the health check to avoid exceptions when being called by other services. Docker introduced native health check implementation after version 1.12. This document introduces the health check of Docker containers.

Process-level health check checks whether or not the process is alive and is the simplest health check for containers. Docker daemon automatically monitors the PID1 process in the container. If the docker run command specifies the restart policy, closed containers can be restarted automatically according to the restart policy. In many real scenarios, process-level health check alone is far from enough. For example, if a container process is still alive, but is locked by an app deadlock and fails to respond to user requests, such problems won't be discovered by process monitoring.
