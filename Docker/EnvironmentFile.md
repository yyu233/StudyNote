Using the .env file allows you to take a write-once-use-often approach to configuring your containers. Although you might not use the exact same variables for various containers, it allows you to create a single .env file and then easily edit the values, so it can be repurposed for other containers. This also makes for easier writing of docker-compose.yml files, as you're not having to hard-code all environment variables.
