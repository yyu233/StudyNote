In programming languages like Java or Golang a dangling block of memory is a block that is not referenced by any piece of code. The garbage collection system of those languages periodically marks the dangling blocks and return it back to the heap, so that these memory blocks are available for future allocations. Similarly a dangling file system layer in Docker is something that is unused and is not being referenced by any images
