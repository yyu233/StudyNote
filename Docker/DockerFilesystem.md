In the container world we use two types of filesystems: overlays and snapshotting filesystems. AUFS and OverlayFS are overlay filesystems which have multiple directories with file diffs for each “layer” in an image. Snapshotting filesystems include devicemapper, btrfs, and ZFS which handle file diffs at the block level. Overlays usually work on common filesystem types such as EXT4 and XFS whereas snapshotting filesystems only run on volumes formatted for them.
