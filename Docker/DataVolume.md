A data volume is a specially-designated directory within one or more containers that bypasses the Union File System. Data volumes provide several useful features for persistent or shared data:

* Volumes are initialized when a container is created. If the containerâ€™s base image contains data at the specified mount point,
that existing data is copied into the new volume upon volume
initialization. (Note that this does not apply when mounting a host
directory.)
* Data volumes can be shared and reused among containers.

* Changes to a data volume are made directly.

* Changes to a data volume will not be included when you update an image.

* Data volumes persist even if the container itself is deleted.
