When a VM doesn't have an external IP address, you might still need to interact with the VM for troubleshooting or maintenance purposes. Setting up a Bastion host, as discussed earlier, is one option but might require more setup than worthwhile for your needs. If you want to troubleshoot a VM without an external IP address, consider enabling interactive access on the serial console, which allows you to interact with a VM's serial console using SSH and run commands against the serial console.
