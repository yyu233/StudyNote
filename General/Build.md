General Steps: 
1. Generating sources (sometimes).
2. Compiling sources.
3. Compiling test sources.
4. Executing tests (unit tests, integration tests, etc).
5. Packaging (into jar, war, ejb-jar, ear).
6. Running health checks (static analyzers like Checkstyle, Findbugs, PMD, test coverage, etc).
7. Generating reports.
