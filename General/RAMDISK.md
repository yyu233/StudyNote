Most users use RAMDisk to speed up applications like:

- Games
- Browser cache for faster web surfing
- Audio and Video editing
- CAD programs
- Software compilers
- Databases
- Speeding up CD duplication
- SETI processing
- TEMP files
- Swap space
- Web server cache
- Security - all information can be wiped upon power loss or shutdown
- Custom applications with high I/O, high bandwidth, or high security requirements

An additional feature of a RAMDisk is that it will never wear out. You can access it at maximum bandwidth 24/7/365 without fear of mechanical failure, or fragmentation (while a RAMDisk can become fragmented just like any other disk, but it does not take a performance hit like a physical disk does when it becomes fragmented). A RAMDisk operating at maximum bandwidth does not produce excessive heat, noise or vibrations.
