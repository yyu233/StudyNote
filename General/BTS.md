A BTS is usually composed of:

* Transceiver (TRX)     
Provides transmission and reception of signals. It also does sending and reception of signals to and from higher network entities (like the base station controller in mobile telephony).
* Power amplifier (PA)  
Amplifies the signal from TRX for transmission through antenna; may be integrated with TRX.
* Combiner  
Combines feeds from several TRXs so that they could be sent out through a single antenna. Allows for a reduction in the number of antenna used.
* Multiplexer   
For separating sending and receiving signals to/from antenna. Does sending and receiving signals through the same antenna ports (cables to antenna).
* Antenna   
This is the structure that the BTS lies underneath; it can be installed as it is or disguised in some way (concealed cellular sites).
* Alarm extension system  
Collects working status alarms of various units in the BTS and extends them to operations and maintenance (O&M) monitoring stations.
* Control function  
Controls and manages the various units of BTS, including any software. On-the-spot configurations, status changes, software upgrades, etc. are done through the control function.
* Baseband receiver unit (BBxx)     
Frequency hopping, signal DSP.
