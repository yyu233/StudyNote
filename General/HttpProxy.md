HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is a protocol for sending and displaying files (text, graphic images, sound, video, and other multimedia files) on the Internet. The HTTP Proxy is a high performance content filter. It examines Web traffic to identify suspicious content, which can be a spyware, malformed content, or another type of attack. It can also protect your Web server from attacks from the external network using protocol anomaly detection rules to identify and deny suspicious packets.
You can configure the HTTP Proxy to:

* Only allow content that matches RFC specifications for Web server and clients
* Restrict the content the Firebox allows into your network, based upon fully a qualified domain name, path name, file name or extension as it appears in the URL.
* Restrict the content the Firebox allows into your network based upon MIME type.
* Block downloads of any unique file type, including client-side executable files like Java and ActiveX, by file header (hexadecimal signature) pattern match.
* Examine the HTTP header to make sure it is not from a known source of suspicious content
