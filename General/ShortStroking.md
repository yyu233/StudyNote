## Short Stroking ## 

Short Stroking is a disk formating practice of only writting into the outer sector.     
This redues latency in I/O intensive environment.   
It can be conjunction with data tiering.   
Critical data resides on the outer sector, whereas trivial data resides on the inner sector.
