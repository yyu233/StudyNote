ACPI (Advanced Configuration and Power Interface) is an industry specification for the efficient handling of power consumption in desktop and mobile computers. ACPI specifies how a computer's basic input/output system, operating system, and peripheral devices communicate with each other about power usage. ACPI is a key component of Intel's "Instantly Available" technology. Microsoft refers to its support as "Always On."

With ACPI, the following capabilities are possible (assuming the operating system supports them):

 

* The user can specify at what time a device, such as a display monitor, is to turn off or on.
* The user of a notebook computer can specify a lower-level of power consumption when the battery starts running low so that essential applications can still be used while other, less important applications are allowed to become inactive.
* The operating system can lower the clock speed during times when applications don't require the full processor clock speed.
* The operating system can reduce motherboard and peripheral device power needs by not activating devices until they are needed.
* The computer can enter a stand-by mode when no one is using it, but with modem power left on to receive incoming faxes.
* Devices can be plug and play. As soon as plugged in, they can be controlled by ACPI.
