While KVM is specifically for controlling computers, a console server can access devices with RS-232 serial ports. These are designed to work with "headless" devices such as routers, LAN switches, Unix® and Linux® servers, firewalls, power distribution units, uninterruptible power supply systems, and storage systems. You'll also see console servers referred to as terminal servers.
