In addition, FCP is also optimized to handle storage traffic. Unlike protocols that run on top of TCP/IP, FCP is a significantly thinner, single-purpose protocol that generally results in a lower switching latency. It also includes a built-in flow control mechanism that ensures data isn't sent to a device (either storage or server) that isn't ready to accept it. In my experience, you can't achieve the same low interconnect latency with any other storage protocol in existence today.
