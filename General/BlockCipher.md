A block cipher consists of two paired algorithms, one for encryption, E, and the other for decryption, D.[1] Both algorithms accept two inputs: an input block of size n bits and a key of size k bits; and both yield an n-bit output block. The decryption algorithm D is defined to be the inverse function of encryption, i.e., D = Eâˆ’1.
