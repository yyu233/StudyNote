The Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP) is a protocol layered on the User Datagram transport Protocol (UDP) used over the Internet Protocol (IPv4 or IPv6).

TFTP is a very simple file transfer protocol. It was first specified in 1980 and provides functions to copy files across a network (a very basic form of FTP). It is defined in [RFC2347]. Since it is so simple, it is easy to implement in a very small amount of memory, an important consideration at that time it was defined. TFTP is therefore sometimes useful for booting or loading the configuration of systems (such as routers, thin client, and wireless base stations) which do not have data storage devices. TFTP has no authentication or encryption mechanisms, and generally provides the same access to all files in the tftp directory. Due to this lack of security, use of tftp can be dangerous over the open Internet. Therefore, TFTP is generally only used on private local area networks for applications where ftp would be too expensive or difficult to implement (e.g. down-loading firmware, software and configuration data to network devices).
