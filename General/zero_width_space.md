## Zero Width Space ## 

Unicode: \u200b

The zero-width space can be used to enable line wrapping in long words, when using languages that donâ€™t use spaces to separate words, or after certain characters like a slash /. Most applications treat the zero-width space like a regular space for word wrapping purposes, even though it is not visible.

Since the Lao written language does not word wrap properly, scripts have been developed for windows and MS word to automatically insert a Zero Width Space (U+200B) between each word. These are indivisible in MS Word, but show up as small forward slashes with a dark grey background in Libreoffice
