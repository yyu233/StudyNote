In SCSI computer storage, computers and storage device use a client-sever model of communication. The computer is a client which requests the storage device to perform a service: read or write.    
SCSI commands are sent in a command descriptor block (CDB). It consists of a 1 byte opcode followed by 5 or more bytes containing command-specific parameters.
