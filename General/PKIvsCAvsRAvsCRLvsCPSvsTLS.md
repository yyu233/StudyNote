Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) is a set of processes, policies and technology for associating cryptographic keys with the entity to whom those keys were issued. It is a well-known authentication and encryption method used in internet banking and e-commerce to confirm the identity of trading partners as well as validate information being shared.  PKI is made of several elements which are:
 
·        Certification Authority (CA) - A trusted entity that serves authentication infrastructures as well as registering entities that need PKI. It is the organization that issues out digital certificates.  Examples of Certification Authorities include: Comodo, Verizon, GoDaddy and so on.
 
·        Registration Authority (RA) - is certified by a root CA and validates the identity of users requesting information on the certificate authority.
 
·        Certificate Revocation List (CRL) - Provides a means for checking the continued validity of the certificates for which the certification authority (CA) has responsibility. The CRL details digital certificates that are no longer valid.
 
·        Certification Practice Statement (CPS) - Is a set of rules governing the CA’s operations. It provides an understanding of the value and trustworthiness of certificates issued by a given CA.
 
Transport Layer Security (TLS) and its predecessor Secure Socket Layer (SSL) is an Internet protocol that is intended to provide security over the internet. TLS uses PKI certificates to authenticate parties communicating with each other as well as encrypting the communication session.
 
 
In summary TLS uses PKI to secure information over the internet. However, it is important to note that TLS supports other encryption standards which are not part of PKI.
