But the fact that simulators and emulators both serve similar purposes does not mean that they work in identical ways. There are essential differences between them.

A simulator is designed to create an environment that contains all of the software variables and configurations that will exist in an applicationâ€™s actual production environment. However, simulators do not attempt to emulate the actual hardware that will host the application in production. Because simulators create only software environments, they can be implemented using high-level programming languages.

In contrast, an emulator does attempt to mimic all of the hardware features of a production environment, as well as software features. To achieve this, you typically need to write an emulator using assembly language.

In a sense, then, you can think of emulators as occupying a middle ground between simulators and real devices. Whereas simulators only mimic environment features that can be configured or defined using software, emulators mimic both hardware and software features.
