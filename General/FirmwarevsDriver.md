While both have the role of allowing hardware to do what is requested of it, one important difference is that firmware is stored on the hardware device itself while drivers are installed inside the operating system. Also, firmware can start on its own and do what it is programmed to do while drivers must be run by the operating system. The biggest difference between the two is that the firmware tells the devices what they should do, while the driver tells the operating system how to communicate with the same devices.
