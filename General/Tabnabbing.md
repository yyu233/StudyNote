Tabnabbing, sometimes called reverse tabnabbing, is an exploit that uses the browser's default behavior with target="_blank" to gain partial access to your page through the window.object API.

With tabnabbing, a page that you link to could cause your page to redirect to a fake login page. This would be hard for most users to notice because the focus would be on the tab that just opened â€“ not the original tab with your page.

Then when a person switches back to the tab with your page, they would see the fake login page instead and might enter their login details.
