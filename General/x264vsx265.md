The major and key difference is that x265 is the successor of x264. But that doesn’t make it the better version (which is usually the case)

—X264

Pros:

Supports up to 4k resolution
Two times more efficient than the earlier version
Cons:

Not suitable for UHD content delivery
—X265

Pros:

Supports up to 8k UHDTV
40% more efficient than x264
Smaller file size
Lower bitrate requirement
Cons:

Drains battery power very quickly
Despite x265 being the latest version and the pros seemingly more advantageous, the answer actually lies in the details.
