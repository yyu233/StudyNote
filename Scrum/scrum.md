**Agile is a set of principles and scrum is a framework for getting s#it done. **

A common way to conduct a stand up is for every team member to answers three questions in the context of achieving the sprint goal:

*      What did I do yesterday?
*      What do I plan to do today?
*      Are there any obstacles?

A scrum team needs three specific roles: product owner, scrum master, and the development team. 

**Product owners** are the champions for their product. They are focused on understanding business, customer, and market requirements, then prioritizing the work to be done by the engineering team accordingly. 

**Scrum masters** are the champions for scrum within their teams. They coach teams, product owners, and the business on the scrum process, and look for ways to fine-tune their practice of it.
