1. Application Programming Interface (API): A toolset for building applications such as an API for developing mobile apps on a particular operating system.
2. Application Server: A software framework used to create and run enterprise applications.
3. Application Integration: Enterprise application integration is an integration framework composed of a collection of technologies and services which form a middleware or “middleware framework” to enable integration of systems and applications across an enterprise.
4. Content-Centric Middleware: Similar to publish/subscribe middleware, content-centric middleware utilizes provider-consumer abstraction to obtain specific content.
5. Data Integration: Tools for data integration, such as an enterprise service bus.
6. Device Middleware: A toolset for developing hardware environment-specific applications.
7. Embedded Middleware: Serving as an intermediary, embedded middleware enables communication between and an integration interface for embedded applications, operating systems, and applications.
8. Games Engines: A framework that enables graphics, physics, scripting, or networking.
9. Message-Oriented Middleware (MOM): Infrastructure that supports the transaction of messages between distributed systems or elements.
10. Object Request Broker (ORB): Object middleware enables the sending of objects and request services by way of an object oriented system
11. Portals: In reference to enterprise portal servers, this piece of software facilitates front-end integration as well as interactions between a device and its back-end system.
12. Remote Procedure Call (RPC): A Remote Procedure Call is used synchronously or asynchronously to call on services from remote systems.
13. Robotic Middleware: Robotic middleware is used to manage the complexity involved when building a robot, such as robot control and simulation.
14. Transaction Processing (TP): Transcation processing middleware is used in transaction processing monitors to provide an environment for developing and deploying disparate applications.
