This is a new C++0x feature that tells the compiler to create the default version of the respective constructor or assignment operator, i.e. the one which just performs the copy or move action for each member. This is useful because the move constructor isn't always generated by default (e.g. if you have a custom destructor), unlike the copy constructor (and likewise for assignment), but if there's nothing non-trivial to write, it's better to let the compiler handle it than to spell it out yourself each time.

Also notice that a default constructor would not be generated if you provide any other non-default constructor. If you still want the default constructor, too, you can use this syntax to have the compiler make one.

As another use case, there are several situations in which a copy constructor would not be generated implicitly (e.g. if you provide a custom move constructor). If you still want the default version, you can request it with this syntax.
