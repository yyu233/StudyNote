When a normal function call instruction is encountered, the program stores the memory address of the instructions immediately following the function call statement, loads the function being called into the memory, copies argument values, jumps to the memory location of the called function, executes the function codes, stores the return value of the function, and then jumps back to the address of the instruction that was saved just before executing the called function. Too much run time overhead.
The C++ inline function provides an alternative. With inline keyword, the compiler replaces the function call statement with the function code itself (process called expansion) and then compiles the entire code. Thus, with inline functions, the compiler does not have to jump to another location to execute the function, and then jump back as the code of the called function is already available to the calling program.

Pros :-
1. It speeds up your program by avoiding function calling overhead.
2. It save overhead of variables push/pop on the stack, when function calling happens.
3. It save overhead of return call from a function.
4. It increases locality of reference by utilizing instruction cache.
5. By marking it as inline, you can put a function definition in a header file (i.e. it can be included in multiple compilation unit, without the linker complaining)

Cons :-
1. It increases the executable size due to code expansion.
2. C++ inlining is resolved at compile time. Which means if you change the code of the inlined function, you would need to recompile all the code using it to make sure it will be updated
3. When used in a header, it makes your header file larger with information which users donâ€™t care.
4. As mentioned above it increases the executable size, which may cause thrashing in memory. More number of page fault bringing down your program performance.
5. Sometimes not useful for example in embedded system where large executable size is not preferred at all due to memory constraints.


Always try to define large functions outside the class, since functions defined inside a class are automatically defined as inline and this will affect the program negatively. You can use scope resolution (::) for this purpose.
