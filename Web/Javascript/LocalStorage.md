Limitation:

* Do not store sensitive user information in localStorage
* It is not a substitute for a server based database as information is only stored on the browser
* LocalStorage is limited to 5MB across all major browsers
* LocalStorage is quite insecure as it has no form of data protection and can be accessed by any code on your web page
* LocalStorage is synchronous. Meaning each operation called would only execute one after the other
