You can search for repeat substrings using capture groups. Parentheses, ( and ), are used to find repeat substrings. You put the regex of the pattern that will repeat in between the parentheses.

To specify where that repeat string will appear, you use a backslash (\) and then a number. This number starts at 1 and increases with each additional capture group you use. An example would be \1 to match the first group.
