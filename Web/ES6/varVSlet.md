One of the biggest problems with declaring variables with the var keyword is that you can overwrite variable declarations without an error.    
In a small application, you might not run into this type of problem, but when your code becomes larger, you might accidentally overwrite a variable that you did not intend to overwrite.   

If you were to replace var with let in the variable declarations of the code above, the result would be an error.
