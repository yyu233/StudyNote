```
the <fieldset> element provides a grouping for a part of an HTML form, with a nested <legend> element providing a caption for the <fieldset>. It takes few attributes, the most notable of which are form, which can contain the id of a <form> on the same page, allowing you to make the <fieldset> part of that <form> even if it is not nested inside it, and disabled, which allows you to disable the <fieldset> and all its contents in one go.
