There are three modes of transmission, namely: simplex, half duplex, and full duplex.  The transmission mode defines the direction of signal flow between two connected devices.

The primary difference between three modes of transmission is that in a simplex mode of transmission the communication is unidirectional, or one-way; whereas in the half duplex mode of transmission the communication is two-directional, but the channel is interchangeably used by both of the connected devices.  On the other hand, in the full duplex mode of transmission, the communication is bi-directional or two-way, and the channel is used by both of the connected devices simultaneously.

|Basis for Comparison	|Simplex|	Half Duplex|	Full Duplex|
|-------------------|-------|------------|------------|
|Direction of Communication	Unidirectional	|Two-directional, one at a time|	Two-directional, simultaneously|
|Send / Receive|	Sender can only send data	|Sender can send and receive data, but one a time|	Sender can send and receive data simultaneously|
|Performance|	Worst performing mode of transmission|	Better than Simplex	|Best performing mode of transmission|
