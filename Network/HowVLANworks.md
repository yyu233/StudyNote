Each VLAN provides data link access to all hosts connected to switch ports configured with the same VLAN ID. The VLAN tag is a 12-bit field in the Ethernet header that provides support for up to 4,096 VLANs per switching domain. VLAN tagging is standardized in IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers) 802.1Q and is often called Dot1Q.

When an untagged frame is received from an attached host, the VLAN ID tag configured on that interface is added to the data link frame header, using the 802.1Q format. The 802.1Q frame is then forwarded toward the destination. Each switch uses the tag to keep each VLAN's traffic separate from other VLANs, forwarding it only where the VLAN is configured. Trunk links between switches handle multiple VLANs, using the tag to keep them segregated. When the frame reaches the destination switch port, the VLAN tag is removed before the frame is to be transmitted to the destination device.
