Ensure multi-site resiliency and disaster recovery (DRP)
To cope with server or network outages, GSLB helps improve website reliability and availability. Automatic cross-datacenter failover is sometimes provided.

Increase datacenter scalability and agility
Add, upgrade and deprovision servers or datacenters transparently

Improve user experience
Route clients to the nearest datacenter. Network latency is minimized by delivering content from a server which is closer to the requesting user. The response time and hence user experience is dependent largely on where the GSLB server is located.

Meet regulatory and security requirements
Enable network architects to service a global user base in a manner that complies with government regulations for highly-regulated industries such as telecommunications, defense and healthcare.
