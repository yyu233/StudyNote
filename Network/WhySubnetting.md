Subnetting is the technique for logically partitioning a single physical network into multiple smaller sub-networks or subnets.

Subnetting enables an organization to conceal network complexity and reduce network traffic by adding subnets without a new network number. When a single network number must be used across many segments of a local area network (LAN), subnetting is essential.

The benefits of subnetting include:

Reducing broadcast volume and thus network traffic
Enabling work from home
Allowing organizations to surpass LAN constraints such as maximum number of hosts
