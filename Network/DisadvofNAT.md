Disadvantages of using NAT
Local computers can access the internet, but there are still some restrictions left. A computer located in the internet is not able to establish a connection to a local computer, all he can do is address (a port of) the router and hope for the best. Usually the addressed port is currently not used and hence the packet will be rejected. Even if the port is currently used by a local machine the packet might be forwarded but will then usually be rejected since the computer is already communicating with a different computer. Establishing connections from the internet to one of the local computers is therefore nearly impossible. For regular services it is possible to statically map ports on the router to sockets in the local net, for example one can configure the router to forward packets arriving at port 80 to a HTTP-server located in the local net.
