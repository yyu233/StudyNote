Client-Server: This constraint operates on the concept that the client and the server should be separate from each other and allowed to evolve individually.   
Stateless: REST APIs are stateless, meaning that calls can be made independently of one another, and each call contains all of the data necessary to complete itself successfully.   
Cache: Because a stateless API can increase request overhead by handling large loads of incoming and outbound calls, a REST API should be designed to encourage the storage of cacheable data.   
Uniform Interface: The key to the decoupling client from server is having a uniform interface that allows independent evolution of the application without having the applicationâ€™s services, or models and actions, tightly coupled to the API layer itself.    
Layered System: REST APIs have different layers of their architecture working together to build a hierarchy that helps create a more scalable and modular application.    
Code on Demand: Code on Demand allows for code or applets to be transmitted via the API for use within the application.
