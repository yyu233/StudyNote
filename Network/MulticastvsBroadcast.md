1. Multicast:one sender (potentially many senders), many receivers 
2. Broadcast: one sender, all others are receivers 

A multicast is a transmission of data from a single source to multiple recipients. Multicasting is similar to broadcasting, but only transmits information to specific users. It is used to efficiently transmit streaming media and other types of data to multiple users at one time.

The simple way to send data to multiple users simultaneously is to transmit individual copies of the data to each user. However, this is highly inefficient, since multiple copies of the same data are sent from the source through one or more networks. Multicasting enables a single transmission to be split up among multiple users, significantly reducing the required bandwidth.
