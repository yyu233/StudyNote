The standard authentication protocol used on encrypted networks is Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP), which provides a secure method to send identifying information over-the-air for network authentication. 802.1X is the standard that is used for passing EAP over wired and wireless Local Area Networks (LAN). It provides an encrypted EAP tunnel that prevents outside users from intercepting information.

The EAP protocol can be configured for credential (EAP-TTLS/PAP and PEAP-MSCHAPv2) and digital certificate (EAP-TLS) authentication and is a highly secure method for protecting the authentication process.
