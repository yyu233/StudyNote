## Difference Between Hub, Bridge, Switch and Gateway ##

**Hub**:  no brain, on-way, from one client to many others. If two client send transmission simultaneously, it may lead to collision.   
**Bridge**: little brain, one-way, from one client to one client. Know who is who.   
**Switch**: more brain, one to many or one to one transimission, allow transmission simultaneously.   
**Gateway**: converter of different protocals to make communication possible between different network.
