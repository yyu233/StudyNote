An IP address is made up of four 8-bit octets; an octet is a sequence of 8 binary bits. Each bit therefore can be either a 0 or a 1, so each octet can represent 2^8 different values, which is 256 (0-255). Since there are four of these octets, there can be a combination of addresses equaling 28+8+8+8, or 232, which is 4,294,967,296 possible addresses. Each binary bit has a value: 128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1, so depending on whether that binary bit is switched on or off, we either add or donâ€™t add the value for that bit.

The mask indicates the amount of addresses that we are ignoring. Basically, where there are 1s, there are addresses that are not a part of the group our address is in. For a /24 network (or network with mask of 255.255.255.0), it means that out of 2^32 possible addresses, we are subtracting 2^24 addresses, so we are left with 2^8 addresses in our group, or 256 of them.

So if you had an address of 172.17.0.0/24, it means that you would have 256 addresses in that network, which would be 172.17.0.0-172.17.0.255, though some would be reserved as the network address (172.17.0.0) and one would be reserved as the broadcast address (172.17.0.255) and you'd also need a gateway (usually 172.17.0.1).
