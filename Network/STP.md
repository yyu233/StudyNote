The Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) is used to create loop-free topology among the switches in each Layer 2 domain. A per-VLAN STP instance can be used, which enables different Layer 2 topologies or a multi-instance STP (MISTP) can be used to reduce STP overhead if the topology is the same among multiple VLANs. STP blocks forwarding on links that might produce forwarding loops, creating a spanning tree from a selected root switch. This blocking means that some links will not be used for forwarding until a failure in another part of the network causes STP to make the link part of an active forwarding path.
