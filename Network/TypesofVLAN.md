Types of VLANs
Types of VLANs include Protocol based, static and dynamic VLANs.

A Protocol VLAN- which has traffic handled based on its protocol. A switch will segregate or forward traffic based on the traffics protocol.

Dynamic VLAN- allows a network administrator just to define network membership based on device characteristics, as opposed to switch port location.
