MTU stands for Maximum Transmission Unit and it is basically a parameter that determines the maximum size of data packets that are allowed to be transferred from the network to your system. If the MTU value is too small, then you are crippling your speed by dealing with large number of packages, and if it is too large, you are letting the data transmission occupy significant portions of your bandwidth for larger periods of time, essentially causing lag. So, there is a golden ratio as in everything really and if you want to squeeze the maximum performance out of your internet connection, you can determine and set your MTU to an optimal value.
