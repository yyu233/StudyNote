An 802.1X network is different from home networks in one major way; it has an authentication server called a RADIUS Server. It checks a user’s credentials to see if they are an active member of the organization and, depending on the network policies, grants users varying levels of access to the network. This allows unique credentials or certificates to be used per user, eliminating the reliance on a single network password that can be easily stolen.

802.1X is a network authentication protocol that opens ports for network access when an organization authenticates a user’s identity and authorizes them for access to the network. The user’s identity is determined based on their credentials or certificate, which is confirmed by the RADIUS server. The RADIUS server is able to do this by communicating with the organization’s directory, typically over the LDAP or SAML protocol.
