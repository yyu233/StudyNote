Statelessness is about making sure that calls to the API aren't tied to a particular server, which increases the likelihood of building scalable server infrastructures. Because the server is stateless, every call to it must include all the data required to execute the request. The HTTP protocol is connectionless (there's no guarantee that your request is going to the same server, or how long it will be between those calls to the server).
