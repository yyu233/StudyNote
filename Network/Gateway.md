## Gateway ##

Gateway is the stop point that routes the data traffic to or from other network.     

For workstatoin, gateway routes traffic from workstation to outside network.   

For home, gateways is the Internet Service Provider that helps you access the internet.

If you have a DSL modem or cable modem you will typically have what is called a gateway or router. The terms gateway and router are often used interchangeably. In many cases the modem and gateway are combined in one unit. This device does quite a few things. It allows you to hook up many, potentially thousands, of devices to your network. The gateway has two IP address. One is an external IP address assigned by your ISP (internet service provider), and the other an internal IP address that is only accessible within your network. This internal IP address is also called you default gateway IP address (GW). All computers on your local network need to know the default gateway IP in order to access the internet.

Even though your ISP only assigns you one IP address, the gateway allows you to have many IP addresses through a technique called Network Address Translation (NAT).
