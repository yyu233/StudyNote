169.254.x.x: This is what's called an Automatic Private IP address. An IP in this range means that the computer cannot see the network. A computer using DHCP needs to have an external server tell it what IP address to use. Unfortunately, if there's no network connectivity, the computer is unable to talk to the server. In those cases, the computer will actually give itself an IP starting with 169.254, since it must assign itself some sort of number. When you see a 169.254.x.x address, you definitely have a problem. It could be as simple as an unplugged network cable, or it could be as complex as the network being down. A fair amount of troubleshooting is involved at this point, but the bottom line is that your computer doesn't even see the network.
