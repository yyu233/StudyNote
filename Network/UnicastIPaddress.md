Common traffic to and from machines today is unicast IP traffic. Unicast traffic is essentially a conversation between two hosts. Though there may be routers between them, the two hosts are carrying on a private conversation. Examples of common unicast traffic are protocols such as HTTP (web), SMTP (sending mail), POP3 (fetching mail), IRC (chat), SSH (secure shell), and LDAP (directory access).
