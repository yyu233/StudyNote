If the RADIUS server sends an Access_Accept packet as a result of an authentication, it may contain certain attributes that provide the switch with information on how to connect the device on the network. Common attributes will specify which VLAN to assign a user to, or possibly a set of ACLs (Access Control Lists) the user should be given once connected. This is commonly called ‘User Based Policy Assignment’ as the RADIUS server is making the decision based on user credentials. Common use cases would be to push guest users to a ‘Guest VLAN’ and employees to an ‘Employee VLAN’.
