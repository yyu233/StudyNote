## Storage Area Network ##

SAN reorginzes storage resources from user network into an independent network, making server which accesses shared storage as if it were a drive directly connected to the server. 

## Fibre Channel ##

The Fibre Channel is a high-speed networking technology for transimitting data at rates of max 128 Gbps. It was created for SAN. 

## Host Bus Adapter (HBA) 

A host bus adapter (HBA) is a circuit board or integrated circuit adapter that prvoides I/O processing and physical connectivity between a host system and a storage. It relieves the host microprocessor of both data storage and retrieval tasks, and therefore it enhances the server's performance time.
