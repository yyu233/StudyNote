0.0.0.0 is a non-routable meta-address used to designate an invalid, unknown or non applicable target (a no particular address placeholder).

In the context of a route entry, it usually means the default route.

In the context of servers, 0.0.0.0 means "all IPv4 addresses on the local machine". If a host has two ip addresses, 192.168.1.1 and 10.1.2.1, and a server running on the host listens on 0.0.0.0, it will be reachable at both of those IPs.

If you are on the client side (like in a browser), it's not going to do anything when you type in a 0.0.0.0 address (you will get site unreachable type of error messages)

From a server point of view, when you are writing some (server side) application and you want it to listen on say port 8000 (say). Now if your system has multiple physical NIC's (let's not get in virtual machine interfaces here to keep it simple) & you want your application to listen to port 8000 on all of these IP addresses, then you specify the address as 0.0.0.0 in the server side code (provided the framework you are using supports it). Basically 0.0.0.0 signifies "listen on all network interfaces". Occasionally (rarely) code may need to behave differently depending on which interface the traffic came through, so one needs to watch out for that in such cases.
