At a high level, subnets and VLANs are analogous in that they both deal with segmenting or partitioning a portion of the network. However, VLANs are data link layer (OSI layer 2) constructs, while subnets are network layer (OSI layer 3) IP constructs, and they address (no pun intended) different issues on a network. Although itâ€™s a common practice to create a one-to-one relationship between a VLAN and subnet, the fact that they are independent layer 2 and layer 3 constructs adds flexibility when designing a network.
