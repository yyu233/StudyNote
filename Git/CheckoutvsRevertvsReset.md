 * The git checkout command can be used in a commit, or file level scope. A file level checkout will change the file's contents to those of the specific commit.  
 * A revert is an operation that takes a specified commit and creates a new commit which inverses the specified commit. git revert can only be run at a commit level scope and has no file level functionality.   
 * A reset is an operation that takes a specified commit and resets the "three trees" to match the state of the repository at that specified commit. A reset can be invoked in three different modes which correspond to the three trees.
