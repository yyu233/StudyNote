## Submodules - repos inside other repos ## 
Git allows you to include other Git repositories called submodules into a repository. This allows you to track changes in several repositories via a central one. Submodules are Git repositories nested inside a parent Git repository at a specific path in the parent repository’s working directory. A submodule can be located anywhere in a parent Git repository’s working directory and is configured via a .gitmodules file located at the root of the parent repository. This file contains which paths are submodules and what URL should be used when cloning and fetching for that submodule. Submodule support includes support for adding, updating, synchronizing, and cloning submodules.
