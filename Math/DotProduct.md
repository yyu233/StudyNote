The dot product of two vectors is defined as: P dot Q = PxQx + PyQy + PzQz

Using the dot product allows us to determine how closely two Vectors are pointing to the same point. If the dot product is negative they are facing in relatively opposite directions, while positive tells us they are pointing in the relative same direction.

If the dot product is 0 then the two Vectors are orthogonal or 90 degrees off.
