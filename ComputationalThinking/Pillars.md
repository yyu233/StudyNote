1. Decomposition: divie big problem into subproblem, connection of dots, make it manageable.   
2. Pattern Recognition: find common pattern (**repetition**) and compress into smaller representation.
3. Data Representation & Abstraciton: filter out unimportant information, look for **keywords**.
4. Algorithm: logical sequence of steps to solve the problem.
