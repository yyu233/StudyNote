* SQLite is an open source project available in the public domain
* MySQL is an open source project which is owned by Oracle.  
SQLite is a server-less database and is self-contained. This is also referred to as an embedded database which means the DB engine runs as a part of the app.
On the other hand, MySQL requires a server to run. MySQL will require a client and server architecture to interact over a network.  


* SQLite supports these datatypes: Blob, Integer, Null, Text, Real.

* MySQL supports the below-mentioned datatypes:
  Tinyint, Smallint, Mediumint, Int, Bigint, Double, Float, Real, Decimal, Double precision, Numeric, Timestamp, Date, Datetime, Char, Varchar, Year, Tinytext,   Tinyblob, Blob, Text, MediumBlob, MediumText, Enum, Set, Longblob, Longtext.
  
 * Multiple Access and Scalability â€“ SQLite vs MySQL
  SQLite does not have any specific user management functionality and hence is not suitable for multiple user access. MySQL has a well-constructed user management system which can handle multiple users and grant various levels of permission.

* SQLite is suitable for smaller databases. As the database grows the memory requirement also gets larger while using SQLite. Performance optimization is harder when using SQLite. This has a few write constraints.
  On the contrary, MySQL is easily scalable and can handle a bigger database with less effort.
