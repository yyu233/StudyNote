Covariate shift is a specific type of dataset shift often encountered in machine learning. It is when the distribution of input data shifts between the training environment and live environment. Although the input distribution may change, the output distribution or labels remain the same. Covariate shift is also known as covariate drift, and is a very common issue encountered in machine learning. Models are usually trained in offline or local environments on a sample of labelled training data. Itâ€™s not unusual for the distribution of inputs in a live and dynamic environment to be different from the controlled training environment.  

Covariate shift can occur gradually over time or suddenly after deployment. In both cases the issue will have an adverse effect on the accuracy of the model. The algorithms will have been trained to map input to output data, and may not recognise input features on a different distribution. This means the model may be less accurate, or completely ineffective. It is a major consideration in machine learning as it means a high performing model on training data may not be accurate once deployed. 

Covariate shift is a common problem faced within the supervised type of machine learning methodology. It will occur when a model has been trained on a dataset with a distribution which is much different to new datasets. Because the distribution of input variables has shifted, the model may misclassify data points in a live environment.
