The Linux kernel generates entropy from keyboard timings, mouse movements, and IDE timings and makes the random character data available to other operating system processes through the special files /dev/random and /dev/urandom. This capability was introduced in Linux version 1.3.30.

There are some Linux kernel patches allowing one to use more entropy sources. The audio_entropyd project, which is included in some operating systems such as Fedora, allows audio data to be used as an entropy source. Also available are video_entropyd which calculates random data from a video-source and entropybroker which includes these three and can be used to distribute the entropy data to systems not capable of running any of these (e.g. virtual machines). Furthermore, one can use the HAVEGE algorithm through haveged to pool entropy. In some systems, network interrupts can be used as an entropy source as well.
