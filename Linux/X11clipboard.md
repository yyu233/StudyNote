For X11-based systems (ie. Linux and most other UNIX-like systems) there are two clipboards which are independent of each other:

PRIMARY - This is copy-on-select, and can be pasted with the middle mouse button.
CLIPBOARD - This is copied with (usually) ^C, and pasted with ^V (It's like MS Windows).
