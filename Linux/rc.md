rc

runcom (as in .cshrc or /etc/rc) The rc command derives from the runcom facility from the MIT CTSS system, ca. 1965. From Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie, as told to Vicki Brown:

"There was a facility that would execute a bunch of commands stored in a file; it was called runcom for "run commands", and the file began to be called "a runcom". rc in Unix is a fossil from that usage."

It contains scripts to used to control the starting, stopping and restarting of daemons. But what exactly is the meaning of rc here?
