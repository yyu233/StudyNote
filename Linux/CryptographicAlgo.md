Pseudo random number generators, or PRNGs, are systems that are efficient in reliably producing lots of artificial random bits from a few true random bits. For example, a RNG which relies on mouse movements or keyboard key presses would stop working once the user stops interacting with the mouse or the keyboard. However a PRNG would use these random bits of initial entropy and continue producing random numbers.

PRNGs maintain a large memory buffer called the entropy pool. The bytes received from the entropy sources (RNG) are stored there. Often the PRNG mixes the entropy pool bytes in order to remove statistical biases in the entropy data. Random bits are generated by running a deterministic random bit generator (DRBG) on the entropy pool data bits. This algorithm is deterministic (it always produces the same output given the same input). The trick is to ensure that the DRBG is never fed the same value input twice!
