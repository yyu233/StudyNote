Provisioning is the process of setting up IT infrastructure. It can also refer to the steps required to manage access to data and resources, and make them available to users and systems. 

Provisioning is not the same thing as configuration, but they are both steps in the deployment process. Once something has been provisioned, the next step is configuration. 

When the term "provisioning" is used, it can mean many different types of provisioning, such as server provisioning, network provisioning, user provisioning, service provisioning, and more.
