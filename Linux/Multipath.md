A path is a connection between a server and the underlying storage. The path can be severed due to many reasons like faulty HBA, faulty cable etc. To avoid such single point of failures, multipathing exists. Multipathing ensures that the system uses multiple physical paths to provide redundancy and increased throughput. There are many vendor specific multipathing implementations like EMCâ€™s powerpath and Symantecs VxDMP.
