1. In general hard link is filesystem object, mount point - is kernel entity. Hardlink will persistent during reboot, mount point - isn't.
2. Modern OS generally don't allow the manual creation of directory hard links because this can result in hard-to-detect cycles that would cause most recursive programs to choke. Such issues could enable DoS attacks and exploitable crashes.mount --bind allows the same functionality, but in a safe way. Any directory mounted under itself will simply appear empty when you try to recurse into it, thereby breaking any such cycles.You can also mount --bind individual files. In this case, the difference is that mount --bind works across filesystems
