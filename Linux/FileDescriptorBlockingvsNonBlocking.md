By default, read() waits until at least one byte is available to return to the application; this default is called "blocking" mode. Alternatively, individual file descriptors can be switched to "non-blocking" mode, which means that a read() on a slow file will return immediately, even if no bytes are available.

The last thing we need to mention for read() is how it behaves on empty pipes. If nobody has the pipe open for writing, read() will always return 0 bytes and not block. If someone does have the pipe open for writing, though, blocking file descriptors will block onread(), and non-blocking ones will return immediately with EAGAIN.
