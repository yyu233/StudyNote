The Linux kernel has two primary functions:     
1. Control access to physical devices     
2. shedule when and how processes interact with the devices     

```/proc/``` directory contains system hardware and running processes information.     
```/proc/``` contains virtual type of file.    

The virtual files are listed as 0 bytes in size. They are constantly updated.
