The priority field or pri for short (“<34>” in the example above) tells you how urgent or severe the event is. It’s a combination of two numerical fields: the facility and the severity. The facility specifies the type of process that created the event, ranging from 0 for kernel messages to 23 for local applications. The severity ranges from 0–7, with 0 indicating an emergency and 7 indicating a debug event.

Pri can be output in two ways. The first is as a single number, prival, which is calculated as the facility field value multiplied by eight, then the result is added to the severity field value: (facility)(8) + (severity). The second is pri-text, which will output in the string format “facility.severity”. The latter format can often be easier to read and search, but takes up more storage space
