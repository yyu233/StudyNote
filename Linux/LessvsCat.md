Less is a file reading program, and Cat is a string manipulation program.

Less is a dedicated file reader that reads a file one screen at a time, and loads more of the file as you scroll through it.

Cat, however, is not a dedicated file reader. The intended use of Cat is to take multiple inputs and stick them end to end. Cat is short for "concatenate", which means exactly that. Cat, by default, outputs the result to standard output, which is normally the command line. However, if Cat has only one argument, it simply spits out the input. For this reason, if you have a small enough file that you don't have to worry about scrolling, Cat can function as a much simpler file reader.
