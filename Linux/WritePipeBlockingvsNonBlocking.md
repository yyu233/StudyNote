Normally, write() will block until it has written all of the data to the file. If you try to write data to a pipe with a full internal buffer, your write() will not return until someone has read enough out of the pipe to make room for all of the data that you're trying to add. If that particular file descriptor (or file structure) is in non-blocking mode, however, write() will write as much data into the file as it can, and then return. This means that it will store as few as 0 bytes, or as much as the full number that was requested.
