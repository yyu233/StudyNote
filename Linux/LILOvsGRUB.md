Linux Loader (LILO) is a generic boot loader for Linux that does not depend on a specific file system and can boot an operating system from floppy and hard disks. You can choose from up to sixteen different images at boot time, and you can set various parameters (like root device) independently for each kernel. LILO can be positioned in the master boot record (MBR) or the boot sector of a partition; if you do the second option, something else must be placed in the MBR to load LILO.

Another boot loader is GNU GRUB (GRUB). GRUB is the reference implementation of the Multiboot Specification, which allows a user to have several different operating systems on his or her computer at once and to choose which one to run. GRUB is dynamically configurable, loading its configuration at startup and allowing boot-time changes, such as selecting different kernels or initial RAM disks. GRUB is highly portable, supports multiple executable formats, and is geometry-translation independent. GRUB can download operating system images from a network, so it can support disk-free systems. GRUB supports automatic decompression of operating system images prior to booting from them. And unlike other boot loaders, it can communicate with a user directly from a GRUB prompt.
