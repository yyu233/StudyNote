In the Linux operating system, a shadow password file is a system file in which encryption user password are stored so that they aren't available to people who try to break into the system. Ordinarily, user information, including passwords, is kept in a system file called /etc/passwd . The password for each user is stored in an encrypted form (some would call it an encoded form since it isn't really encrypted by the usual algorithm) that is created and used as follows:

The original password is encrypted (or encoded) by using a randomly-generated value or encryption key between 1 and 4096 and a one-way hashing function to arrive at the encoded password that is actually stored. Note that the stored result is not something that you can enter as a password itself.
The key (referred to as the salt) is stored with the encoded password. Note the key itself can't be used to decode the encrypted/encoded password because the encoding is one-way. You can't decode the result back into the original password by using the key.
When someone enters a password, their password is then rehashed with the salt value and compared with the encoded password value. If they match, the user is given access to the system.
