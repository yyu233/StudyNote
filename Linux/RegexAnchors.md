Anchors belong to the family of regex tokens that don't match any characters, but that assert something about the string or the matching process. Anchors assert that the engine's current position in the string matches a well-determined location: for instance, the beginning of the string, or the end of a line. 

This type of assertion is useful for several reasons. First, it is expressive: it lets you specify that you want to match digits at the end of a line, but not anywhere else. Second, it is efficient: when you tell the engine that you want to find a compex pattern at a given location, it doesn't have to spend time trying to find that pattern at many other locations. This is why the regex style guide recommends using anchors whenever possibleâ€”even when your regex would match without them.
