Only the OS has any say on physical memory, and userspace applications can't even see where things are in physical memory underneath. Remember that the virtual-memory to physical-memory mappings have a very small granularity (4KB is quite typical), meaning that it wouldn't matter if the 2 physical 1GB-blocks weren't contiguous, the OS can still map them into a contiguous 2GB block of virtual memory. In the extreme case, the OS could map 512x1024 (524288) completely different, non-contiguous 4KB blocks of physical memory into a contiguous 2GB block of virtual memory.

So in summary, malloc will always allocate contiguous blocks of virtual memory, but it has no say on and no knowledge of if they're physically contiguous.
