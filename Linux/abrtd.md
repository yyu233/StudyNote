abrtd is a daemon that watches for application crashes. When a crash occurs, it collects the problem data (core file, application’s command line, …) and takes action according to the configuration and the type of application that crashed.

By default it uses inotify interface [3] to monitor the dump location (/var/spool/abrt/) for new directories created by C/C++ hook and a Socket API (/var/run/abrt/abrt.socket) used by other hooks like Python hook.

The reason for using socket instead of direct filesystem access is security. When a Python script throws unhandled exception, Python hook catches it, running as a part of the broken Python application. The application is running with certain SELinux privileges, for example it can not execute other programs, or to create files in /var/spool/abrt or anything else required to properly fill a problem directory. Adding these privileges to every application would weaken the security. The most suitable solution for the Python application is to open a socket where abrtd is listening, write all relevant data to that socket, and close it. abrtd handles the rest of the processes.
