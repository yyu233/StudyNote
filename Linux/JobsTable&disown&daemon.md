Typically, the shell keeps a list of jobs in a job table. Recall that a job corresponds to a process group, which consists of all the members of a pipeline and their descendants. The jobs command will list the background jobs existing in the job table, along with their job number and job state (stopped or running). When a session ends when the user logs out (exits the shell, which terminates the session leader process), the shell process sends SIGHUP to all jobs, and waits for the process groups to end before terminating itself.

The disown command can be used to remove jobs from the job table, so that when the session ends the child process groups are not sent SIGHUP, nor does the shell wait for them to terminate. They thus become orphan processes, and may be terminated by the operating system, though more often this is used so the processes are adopted by init (the kernel sets their parent process to init) and continue executing as daemons. Alternatives to prevent jobs from being terminated include nohup and using a terminal multiplexer.
