 When the device file is opened without the O_DIRECT flag, the page cache associated with the inode is used to buffer reads, including readahead, and to buffer writes, usually delaying writes until the normal writeback process flushes them out. When O_DIRECT is used, reads and writes go directly to the block device. Similarly when a filesystem mounts a block device, reads and writes from the filesystem usually go directly to the device, though some filesystems (particularly the ext* family) can access the same page cache (traditionally known as the buffer cache in this context) to manage some of the filesystem data.
