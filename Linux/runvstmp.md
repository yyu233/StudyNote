The directories /tmp and /usr/tmp (later /var/tmp) used to be the dumping ground for everything and everybody. The only protection mechanism for files in these directories is the sticky bit which restricts deletion or renaming of files there to their owners. As marcelm pointed out in a comment, there's in principle nothing that prevents someone to create files with names that are used by services (such as nginx.pid or sshd.pid). (In practice, the startup scripts could remove such bogus files first, though.)

/run was established for non-persistent runtime data of long lived services such as locks, sockets, pid files and the like. Since it is not writable for the public, it shields service runtime data from the mess in /tmp and jobs that clean up there. Indeed: Two distributions that I run (no pun intended) have permissions 75
