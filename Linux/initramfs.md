In a nutshell, when your bootloader (GRUB?) loads your Linux kernel, it is of course the kernelâ€™s job to finish the boot process. But to do so, it might require particular drivers to be able to work with, say, hardware RAID controllers, or a network, and so on. And depending on where those critically important drivers are, the kernel might not have the ability to load them; hence, the creation of a preliminary root file system that would contain just enough in the way of loadable modules to give the kernel access to the rest of the hardware.
