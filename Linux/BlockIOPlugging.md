The block I/O layer includes a mechanism, called plugging, that adjusts the rate at which requests are dispatched to the device driver. If requests are queued to a block device which the block layer does not regard as under load or under stress (that is, with a low number of pending requests), the dispatch of newly-issued operations to the driver is delayed (and the device is said to be plugged). This allows to the block layer to perform a higher number of merges, if more I/O is issued closely (with regard to time and space). After a certain amount of time, or when the number of outstanding I/O for a device exceeds a fixed threshold, the device is unplugged, and the requests are actually dispatched to the device driver.
