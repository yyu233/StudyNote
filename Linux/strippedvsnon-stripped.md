If you compile an executable with gcc's -g flag, it contains debugging information. That means for each instruction there is information which line of the source code generated it, the name of the variables in the source code is retained and can be associated to the matching memory at runtime etc. Strip can remove this debugging information and other data included in the executable which is not necessary for execution in order to reduce the size of the executable.
