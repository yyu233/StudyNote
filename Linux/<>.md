<> file opens the file (on file descriptor 0 (stdin) by default, like <) in read+write mode without truncation and creating the file if it didn't exist beforehand.

That corresponds to the O_RDWR|O_CREAT flags passed to the open() system call. By contrast < is O_RDONLY and > is O_WRONLY|O_CREAT|O_TRUNC and >> O_WRONLY|O_CREAT|O_APPEND.

Having stdin writable is not often useful as applications usually don't write to their stdin. Applications usually don't expect to read and write on a file descriptor they receive on startup; they usually read from stdin (or a file descriptor they open themselves) and write to stdout or stderr (or a file descriptor they open themselves).

<> can have its uses:

   * You may prefer cat <> file over cat < file if you don't want the command to fail if file doesn't exist, but an empty file created instead.

   * The non-truncating aspect of <> makes it useful to overwrite files in place. In that case however, you generally don't use it on file descriptor 0:

    printf xxx 1<> file

   * replaces the first 3 bytes of file with xxx.

   * On some systems like Linux, <> on a named pipe (FIFO) opens the named pipe without blocking (without waiting for some other process to open the other end), and ensures the pipe structure is left alive. For instance in:

    mkfifo pipe; sed 's/foo/bar/g' <> pipe

   sed handles incoming data from any number of other processes writing to it and never sees eof.
