At the heart of systemd are unit files. A unit file is a plain text file that lives under the /lib/systemd/system directory and has a type associated with it. A unit file basically describes a resource and tells systemd how to activate that resource. The naming standard for a unit file is <resource_name>.<unit_type>. The different types of units include service, path, mount point, automount, swap, target, timer, device, and socket. So, we have unit files like cron.service, tmp.mount, syslog.socket, or graphical.target. For each service unit thatâ€™s enabled, a symbolic link to the unit file is placed under the /etc/systemd/system/<target>.wants/ directory.
