As we all know YUM is an open-source command-line package-management utility for Linux systems using the RPM Package Manager. As a Linux user, it is very useful for us. It manages packages, dependencies and updates on Linux systems. When a package is downloaded, installed and removed there are chances that the package may still be stored in YUMâ€™s cache. The cached packages are usually located in /var/cache/yum.

There will be situations where we need to clean the YUM cache to reclaim the disk space used or to fix some errors due to corrupted metadata files.
