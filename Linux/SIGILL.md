It means the CPU attempted to execute an instruction it didn't understand. This could be caused by corruption I guess, or maybe it's been compiled for the wrong architecture (in which case I would have thought the O/S would refuse to run the executable). Not entirely sure what the root issue is.
Another cause of execing an invalid instruction is jumping to an address that isn't in the program area.
