A subshell executes its contents in a chain (i.e., it groups them). This actually makes intuitive sense as a subshell is created simply by surrounding the chain of commands with (). But, aside from the contents of the subshell being grouped together in execution, you can still use a subshell as if it were a single command. That is, a subshell still has an stdin, stdout and stderr so you can pipe things to and from a subshell.

On the other hand, command substitution is not the same thing as simply chaining commands together. Rather, command substitution is meant to act a bit like a variable access but with a function call. Variables, unlike commands, do not have the standard file descriptors so you cannot pipe anything to or from a variable (generally speaking), and the same is true of command substitutions.
