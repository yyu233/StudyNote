The block I/O layer is the kernel subsystem in charge of managing input/output operations performed on block devices. The need for a specific kernel component for managing such operations is given by the additional complexity of block devices with respect to, for example, character devices. When we think about a character device (e.g. the keyboard weâ€™re writing with), we think about a stream, which has a cursor running along one only direction. In other words, the information kept in the stream can be read in only one order, and is usually read until a certain position, or until a certain special character is encountered (e.g. EOF, the end-of-file character). A block device is different: data can be read from it in any order and from any position, after one or more seeks. Extra care is needed while reading from a block device, not so much for handling the I/O itself, as for ensuring performance; in fact, block I/O devices are mainly exploited as storage devices, and it is important to exploit as much as possible their potential.
