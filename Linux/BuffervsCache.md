* Buffer is always implemented in the main memory (RAM), but, cache can be implemented in RAM as well as in Disk.
* Buffer memory is used to cope up with the different speed between sender and receiver of the data stream whereas, the cache is a memory which stores the data so that access speed can be fastened for repeatedly used data.
* Buffering and Caching both stores the data temporarily but both are used for different purpose. Where buffer matches the speed between two communicating devices and the cache fastens the access to data that is repeated visited.
* Buffers are implemented in three capacities.
* Zero Capacity
* Bounded Capacity
* Unbonded Capacity
* Cache have 3 Level.
* Level 1 cache
* Level 2 Cache
* Level 3 Cache
