As soon as the positions of the blocks to be mapped into memory are available, the kernel starts to build the I/O requests to forward to the disk device. The block I/O layer creates a list of block I/O structures (called bio), each representing an I/O operation to be submitted to disk. Such structures hide to the upper levels of the hierarchy the specific features of the block device, providing them with an an abstract view of the devices. In the simplest case of small I/O operations one single bio is created, while in more complex cases (large-sized I/Os, vector I/O) the block layer can initiate more I/O operations at a time. Subsequently, the block layer translates I/O operations to requests made for specific sectors, to be sent to the disk controller itself; each request normally contains one or more bios (Figure 2): this helps reducing per-strucure processing overheads. Each of these requests is represented by a request structure; their dispatch to the device driver can be controlled by service policies, implemented in the I/O scheduling sub-component of the block layer.
