mtu 1500 maximum transmission unit = 1500 bytes, this is the largest size that a frame sent over this interface can be. This number is usually limited by the Ethernet protocol's cap of 1500. If you send a larger packet and it arrives at an ethernet interface, then the frame will get fragmented and its payload transmitted in 2 or more packets. Not really any benefit to that, so it's best to follow standards
