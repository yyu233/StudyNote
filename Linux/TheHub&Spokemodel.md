The hub and spoke model of Anaconda has several advantages, including:
* users are not forced to go through the screens in some strictly defined order
* users are not forced to visit every screen no matter if they understand what the options configured in it mean or not
* it is good for the transactional mode where all desired values can be set while nothing is actually happening to the underlying machine until a special button is clicked
* it provides way to show an overview of the configured values
* it has a great support for extensibility, because additional spokes can be put on hubs without need to reorder anything and resolve some complex ordering dependencies
* it can be used for both graphical and text mode of the installer
