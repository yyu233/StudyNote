An inode is an artifact of a particular file-system and how it manages indirection. A "traditional *ix" file-system uses this to link together files into directories, and even multiple parts of a file together. That is, an inode represents a physical manifestation of the file-system implementation.

On the other hand, a file descriptor is an opaque identifier to an open file by the Kernel. As long as the file remains open that identifier can be used to perform operations such as reading and writing. The usage of "file" here is not to be confused with a general "file on a disk" - rather a file in this context represents a stream and operations which can be performed upon it, regardless of the source.
