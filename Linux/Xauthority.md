When you connect to a remove machine via ssh with X11 forwarding enabled, ssh on the server creates a .Xauthority file in the user's home directory. Because ssh listens for X11 on a TCP socket, anyone can connect. Because anyone can connect, we need some way of preventing just anyone from using your display. This is done with that .Xauthority file. The file contains a "cookie" which is presented to the X11 server that verifies the client should be allowed to connect.
