**Yum** command would download the software along with other dependent software in the yum repo created by the developers. Use yum to download, remove or query packages.

### Why RPM ### 
1. RPM maintains a database of installed software packages. Easy to query and verify.    
2. Add package to yum. Centralized location for packages.  
3. Digitally sign the package with GPG key.
