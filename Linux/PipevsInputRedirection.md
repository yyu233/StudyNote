Within the context which the pipelines were created, they actually were not just communication device, but also save storage space and simplify the development. Sure, we can use output/input redirection for everything (especially nowadays with storage capacity being in the range of Terabytes), however that would be inefficient from the storage point of view, and also processing speed - remember that you're directly feeding output from one command to another with |. Consider something like command1 | grep 'something'. If you write output of command1 first to a file, it will take time to write everything, then let grep go through the whole file. With pipeline and the fact that the output is buffered (meaning that left-side process pauses before right-side process is ready to read again), the output goes directly from one command to the other, saving time.
