If the hypervisor is known to do own I/O scheduling, then guests often benefit greatly from the noop I/O scheduler. It allows the host/hypervisor to optimize the I/O requests and prioritize based on it's view on the I/O from one or multiple guests. The noop scheduler can still combine small requests from the guest OS into larger requests before handing the I/O to the hypervisor, however noop follows the idea to spend as few CPU cycles as possible in the guest for I/O scheduling. The host/hypervisor will have an overview of the requests of all guests and have a separate strategy for handling I/O.
