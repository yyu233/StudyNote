Arguments are a list of strings provided to the command as it starts, usually by specifying them after the command name (e.g. echo these are some arguments or rm file1 file2). 

STDIN, on the other hand, is a stream of bytes (sometimes text, sometimes not) that the command can (optionally) read after it starts.
