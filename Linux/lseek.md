lseek moves the internal pointer of the supplied file descriptor to the byte with position pointed to by the second argument, starting from SEEK_SET (the beginning), SEEK_CUR (current position) or SEEK_END (the end). Any consecutive read and write calls on the same descriptor will start their action from this position. Note that lseek is not implemented for all kinds of descriptors - it makes sense for a file on disk, but not for a socket or a pipe.
