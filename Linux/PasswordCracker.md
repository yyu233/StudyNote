In spite of encoding the password with a randomly-generated one-way hash function, a cracker could still break the system if they got access to the /etc/passwd file. Using an approach known as the dictionary attack, a cracker could methodically test each encoded password in the file against their dictionary of commonly-used passwords, each encoded 4096 different ways (to cover all the hash possibilities). Assuming that the system was lax in its password creation requirements and some user used one of the many commonly-used passwords, at least one password could be discovered. In Linux, this possibility can be foreclosed by simply moving the passwords in the /etc/passwd file to another file, usually named /etc/shadow and making this file readable only by those who have access to the system root directory. Using a shadow password file requires that the Linux system installer also install the optional Shadow Suite, which, like Linux, is open source software and available from a number of sites on the Web.
