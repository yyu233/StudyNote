Descriptor Privilege Level (DPL) is the highest level of privilege that can access the resource and is defined. This value is defined in the Segment Descriptor. Requested Privilege Level (RPL) is defined in the Segment Selector, the last two bits. Mathematically, CPL is not allowed to exceed MAX(RPL,DPL), and if it does, this will cause a general protection fault.
