The Device Mapper is a kernel driver that provides a framework for volume management. It provides a generic way of creating mapped devices, which may be used as logical volumes. It does not specifically know about volume groups or metadata formats.
The Device Mapper provides the foundation for a number of higher-level technologies. In addition to LVM, Device-Mapper multipath and the dmraid command use the Device Mapper. The application interface to the Device Mapper is the ioctl system call. The user interface is the dmsetup command.
LVM logical volumes are activated using the Device Mapper. Each logical volume is translated into a mapped device. Each segment translates into a line in the mapping table that describes the device. The Device Mapper supports a variety of mapping targets, including linear mapping, striped mapping, and error mapping. So, for example, two disks may be concatenated into one logical volume with a pair of linear mappings, one for each disk. When LVM creates a volume, it creates an underlying device-mapper device that can be queried with the dmsetup command
