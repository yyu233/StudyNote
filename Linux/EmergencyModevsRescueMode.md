Emergency mode provides the most minimal environment possible and allows you to repair your system even in situations when the system is unable to enter rescue mode. In emergency mode, the system mounts the root file system only for reading, does not attempt to mount any other local file systems, does not activate network interfaces, and only starts a few essential services.

 hen a system has problems severe enough…to keep it from booting into a multi-user target,…sometimes we can use rescue mode or emergency mode…to look around and diagnose an issue.…On systems running System D,…rescue mode and emergency mode are targets…that take the system into a single-user environment.…Rescue mode boots a single-user shell,…starts some system services…and tries to mount available file systems.…Emergency mode starts a single-user shell…in a read-only root file system.…Neither mode enables network connections though
