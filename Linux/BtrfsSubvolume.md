 Subvolumes donâ€™t have a fixed size, but are allocated space dynamically from the storage pool as data are added and removed. We can create subvolumes as easily as creating new directories, and can have nested subvolumes just like having sub-directories inside of directories. There is always a top-level default subvolume that is mounted by default, and all of its subvolumes. We can change the default, and can mount a subvolume without mounting the top-level subvolume that contains it.
