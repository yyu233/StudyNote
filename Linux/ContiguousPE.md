If a logical volume is to be used for root, boot, primary swap, or dump, the physical extents must be contiguous, which means that the physical extents must be allocated in increasing order with no gaps on a single physical volume. For logical volumes that are not being used for root, boot, primary swap or dump, physical extents that correspond to contiguous logical extents within a logical volume can be noncontiguous on a physical volume or reside on entirely different disks. As a result, a file system created within one logical volume can reside on more than one disk.
