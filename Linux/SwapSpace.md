Swap space in Linux is used when the amount of physical memory (RAM) is full. If the system needs more memory resources and the RAM is full, inactive pages in memory are moved to the swap space. While swap space can help machines with a small amount of RAM, it should not be considered a replacement for more RAM. Swap space is located on hard drives, which have a slower access time than physical memory.

Swap space is partition at the install time.    


|Amount of RAM in the System |	Recommended Amount of Swap Space |
|------|----|
|4GB of RAM or less|	a minimum of 2GB of swap space|
|4GB to 16GB of RAM	|a minimum of 4GB of swap space|
|16GB to 64GB of RAM|	a minimum of 8GB of swap space|
|64GB to 256GB of RAM	|a minimum of 16GB of swap space|
|256GB to 512GB of RAM	|a minimum of 32GB of swap space|
