A target unit is a special kind of unit file because it doesn’t represent a single resource; rather, it groups other units to bring the system to a particular state. Target units in systemd loosely resemble run levels in System V in the sense that each target unit represents a particular system state. For example, the graphical.target unit represents a system that has booted in multi-user, graphical mode, similar to System V’s runlevel 5. Multi-user.target, on the other hand, is similar to runlevel 3 (multi-user, text mode with networking enabled). However, targets are also different from runlevels because in System V, a Linux box can exist in only one runlevel at any time. In systemd, target units are inclusive. A target unit can group other target units when it’s coming up—so it’s possible for a system to remain in more than one target. Going back to the graphical.target example, when the target comes up, it also activates multi-user.target
