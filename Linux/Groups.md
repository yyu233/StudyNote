There are two types of groups that a user can belong to:

Primary or login group â€“ is the group that is assigned to the files that are created by the user. Usually, the name of the primary group is the same as the name of the user. Each user must belong to exactly one primary group.

Secondary or supplementary group - used to grant certain privileges to a set of users. A user can be a member of zero or more secondary groups
