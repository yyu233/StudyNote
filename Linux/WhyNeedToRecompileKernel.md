To upgrade to a newer version of the kernel - like all other software, kernel also has bugs. for the linux kernel, each day 100s of commits are made to 10â€™s of modules (separate sub-components) as a part of new feature, new hardware or fix to older code which might have been diagnosed later to contain some errors. a newer version of the kernel containing support / fixes is usually available for use. you can compile this newer version and run it on your computer.
sometimes binaries (assembly level instructions) of the kernel are not available for your hardware. in such cases, you download code, compile it and generate binaries of the code that is compatible with your hardware.
for fun and profit! newer kernels are faster, are usually more secure and support multiple new features
If you want to make changes to your existing kernel, it is (almost) impossible to make changes in the binary format of the kernel. In such cases, you can download and make changes to the source code of the Kernel and then compile it so that your changes are reflected in the binary form of the kernel. This customized or modified kernel (often called tainted kernel) can now be run on your hardware with a new feature that you! (yes you, kernel developer) has implemented.
