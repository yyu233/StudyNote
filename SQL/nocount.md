When you use SET NOCOUNT ON, the message that indicates the number of rows that are affected by the T-SQL statement is not returned as part of the results. When you use SET NOCOUNT OFF; the count is returned. Using SET NOCOUNT ON can improve performance because network traffic can be reduced. SET NOCOUNT ON prevents SQL Server from sending DONE_IN_PROC message for each statement in a stored procedure or batch of SQL statements.
