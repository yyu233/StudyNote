Singleton Pattern says that just"define a class that has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it".

In other words, a class must ensure that only single instance should be created and single object can be used by all other classes.

There are two forms of singleton design pattern

Early Instantiation: creation of instance at load time.
Lazy Instantiation: creation of instance when required.
