1. Open Close Principle  
Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension, but closed for modification.
2. Single Responsibility Principle   
A class should have a single responsibility, where a responsibility is nothing but a reason to change.
3. Dependency Inversion Principle   
Depend upon Abstractions. Do not depend upon concretions.   
Abstractions should not depend upon details. Details should depend upon abstractions.    
High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.   
4. Interface Segregation Principle   
Many client specific interfaces are better than one general purpose interface.  
5. Law of Demeter   
You only ask for objects which you directly need.
6. Liskov Substitution Principle      
In a computer program, if S is a subtype of T, then objects of type T may be replaced with objects of type S (i.e. an object of type T may be substituted with any object of a subtype S) without altering any of the desirable properties of the program (correctness, task performed, etc.)
