## Dependency Injection ##

Dependency injection ensures the Java class has no hard dependencies, which means it does not rely on an instance of a certain class. This allows you to testyour class in isolation, for example by using mock objects.

Mock objects (mocks) are objects which behave similar as the real object. But these mocks are not programmed; they are configured to behave in a certain predefined way. Mock is an English word which means to mimic or to imitate.
