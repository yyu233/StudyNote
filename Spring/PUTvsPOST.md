The important difference is whether the URI (which includes the ID of the resource) needs to be generated by the server or not. Here is how PUT and POST think about it:

If you need the server to return the URI of the created resource (or the data you use to construct the URI), then you must use POST.
This is the case for our Cash Card API: To create a Cash Card, we provide the POST /cashcards endpoint. The actual URI for the created Cash Card depends on the generated ID, and is provided by the server, for example, /cashcards/101 if the ID of the created card is 101.

Alternatively, when the resource URI is known at creation time (as is the case in our example Invoice API), you can use PUT.
For the Invoice API, we could write a Create endpoint that accepts requests such as PUT /invoice/1234-567. The corresponding Read call would use the exact same URI: GET /invoice/1234-567.
