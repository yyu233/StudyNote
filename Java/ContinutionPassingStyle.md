 A continuation is a function that represents the "rest of the computation given a point in the computation". Naively put, break an algorithm into two parts, have the first part call the second part in the return statement, and then the second part is your continuation. Perhaps you want to count all the files in a set of directories. You might create one function that finds all your directories ( f( ) ) and another function that counts files in a directory ( g( ) ). If you pass g( ) to f( ) as a parameter, and you code f( ) to do it's work and then call g( ), then you have composed a new function and g( ) is the continuation
