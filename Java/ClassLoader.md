Class loaders are responsible for loading Java classes during runtime dynamically to the JVM (Java Virtual Machine). Also, they are part of the JRE (Java Runtime Environment). Hence, the JVM doesn’t need to know about the underlying files or file systems in order to run Java programs thanks to class loaders.

Also, these Java classes aren’t loaded into memory all at once, but when required by an application. This is where class loaders come into the picture. They are responsible for loading classes into memory.
