Just to clarify, this '.class' method is not referring to the bytecode file you see after compiling java code nor a confusion between the concepts of Class vs. Object in OOP theory.

This '.class' method is used in Java for code Reflection. Generally you can gather meta data for your class such as the full qualified class name, list of constants, list of public fields, etc, etc.

Check these links (already mentioned above) to get all the details:

Normally you don't plan on using Reflection right away when you start building your project. It's something that you know you need after trying to manage already working code. Many times you need it to manage multiple instances of your program. Maybe you want to identify each particular 'clone' to determine if something is already defined, or count the number of functions, or just simply log the details of a particular instance of your class.
