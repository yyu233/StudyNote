Server Programs such as database and web servers repeatedly execute requests from multiple clients and these are oriented around processing a large number of short tasks. An approach for building a server application would be to create a new thread each time a request arrives and service this new request in the newly created thread. While this approach seems simple to implement, it has significant disadvantages. A server that creates a new thread for every request would spend more time and consume more system resources in creating and destroying threads than processing actual requests.

Since active threads consume system resources, a JVM creating too many threads at the same time can cause the system to run out of memory. This necessitates the need to limit the number of threads being created.

A thread pool reuses previously created threads to execute current tasks and offers a solution to the problem of thread cycle overhead and resource thrashing. Since the thread is already existing when the request arrives, the delay introduced by thread creation is eliminated, making the application more responsive.
