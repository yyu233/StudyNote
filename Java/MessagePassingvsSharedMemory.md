1. Message Passing Model: Message passing model allows multiple processes to read and write data to the message queue without being connected to each other. Messages are stored on the queue until their recipient retrieves them. Message queues are quite useful for interprocess communication and are used by most operating systems.The message passing model has slower communication than the shared memory model because the connection setup takes time.
2. The shared memory in the shared memory model is the memory that can be simultaneously accessed by multiple processes. An advantage of shared memory model is that memory communication is faster as compared to the message passing model on the same machine.
