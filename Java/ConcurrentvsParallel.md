**Concurrency**: the property of a system which enables units of the program, algorithm, or problem to be executed out-of-order or in partial order without affecting the final outcome

**Parallel Computing**: a type of computation in which many calculations or the execution of processes are carried out simultaneously. Thus parallel computing leverages the property of concurrency to execute multiple units of the program, algorithm, or problem simultaneously.
