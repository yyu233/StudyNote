Method-level synchronization is performed implicitly, as part of method invocation and return. A synchronized method is distinguished in the run time constant pool's method info sttrucutre by the ACCSYNCHRONIZED flag, which is checked by the method invocation instructions. 
When invoking a method for which ACCSYNCHRONIZED is set, the executing thread enters a monitor, invokes the method itself, and exits the monitor whether the method invocation completes normally or abruptly. During the time the excuting thread owns the monitor, no other thread may enter it. If an exception is thrown during invocation of the synchronized method and the synchronized method deos not handle the exception, the monitor for the method is automatically exited before the exception is rethrown out of the synchronized method.
