## Static Type Checking vs Dynamic Type Checking ## 

The Java language is designed to enforce type safety. This means that programs are prevented from accessing memory in inappropriate ways. More specifically, every piece of memory is part of some Java object. Each object has some class. For example, a calendar-management applet might use classes like Date, Appointment, Alarm, and GroupCalendar. Each class defines both a set of objects and operations to be performed on the objects of that class. In our calendar management example, the Alarm class might define a turnOn operation, but the Date class would neither need nor allow turnOn. Type safety means that a program cannot perform an operation on an object unless that operation is valid for that object.
