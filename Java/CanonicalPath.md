## Canonical Path ##

All canonical paths are absolute (but not all absolute paths are canonical). A single file existing on a system can have many different paths that refer to it, but only one canonical path. Canonical gives a unique absolute path for a given file. The details of how this is achieved are probably system-dependent.    

Use canonical path to test if two file paths are same.
