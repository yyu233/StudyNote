## Annotation ##

1. Annotations do not change action of a compiled program.
2. Annotations help to associate metadata (information) to the program elements i.e. instance variables, constructors, methods, classes, etc.
3. Annotations are not pure comments as they can change the way a program is treated by compiler. See below code for example.
