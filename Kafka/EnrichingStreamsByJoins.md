Streams can be enriched with data from other streams or tables through joins. A join enriches data by performing lookups in a streaming context where data is updated continuously and concurrently. For example, applications backing an online retail store might enrich new data records with information from multiple databases. In this scenario, it may be that a stream of customer transactions is enriched with sales price, inventory, customer information, etc. These lookups can be performed at very large scale and with a low processing latency.
