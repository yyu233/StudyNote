The advice to avoid directly mutating the state and instead make a copy of it is related to best practices in state management and immutability. It is especially relevant when working with state in React, Redux, or similar frameworks. Here's why it's important:

Predictable State Changes: Immutability ensures that state changes are predictable. When you modify the state directly, it can lead to unexpected side effects, bugs, and difficulties in debugging. By creating a new copy of the state, you maintain the current state's integrity while making the desired updates in a controlled way.

Reference Comparison: React and many state management libraries use reference comparisons to determine whether the state has changed. When you directly mutate the state, the reference doesn't change, and these libraries may not recognize the state change. This can lead to components not re-rendering when they should.

Time-Travel Debugging: Immutability is essential for tools like time-travel debugging. When you create copies of the state at each change, you can store the entire state history and revert to previous states for debugging purposes.

Concurrent Mode: React's Concurrent Mode relies on pure functions and immutability to provide smooth user experiences and optimizations. When state is mutated directly, it can interfere with Concurrent Mode's capabilities.
