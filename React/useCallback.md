In every re-render, React will create a new function, which would trigger a prop change and cause the component to re-render. When you define a function outside of a prop, you can take advantage of another Hook called useCallback. This will memoize the function, meaning that it will only create a new function if certain values change. If nothing changes, the program will use the cached memory of the function instead of recalculating it. Some components may not need that level of optimization, but as a rule, the higher a component is likely to be in a tree, the greater the need for memoization
