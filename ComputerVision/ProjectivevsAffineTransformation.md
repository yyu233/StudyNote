The sole difference between these affine and projective transformations is in the last line of the transformation matrix. For affine transformations, the first two elements of this line are zeros. This leads to the following differences in operations properties:

Projective transformations do not preserve parallelism, length, and angle.
Affine transformations, unlike the projective ones, preserve parallelism.
