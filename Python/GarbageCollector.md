The main garbage collection algorithm used by CPython is reference counting. The basic idea is that CPython counts how many different places there are that have a reference to an object. Such a place could be another object, or a global (or static) C variable, or a local variable in some C function. When an objectâ€™s reference count becomes zero, the object is deallocated. If it contains references to other objects, their reference counts are decremented. Those other objects may be deallocated in turn, if this decrement makes their reference count become zero, and so on. The reference count field can be examined using the sys.getrefcount function (notice that the value returned by this function is always 1 more as the function also has a reference to the object when called)
