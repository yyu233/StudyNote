## Concatenate String ## 
Strings can be concatenated (glued together) with the + operator, and repeated with *:

```
>>> # 3 times 'un', followed by 'ium'
>>> 3 * 'un' + 'ium'
'unununium'
```

Two or more string literals (i.e. the ones enclosed between quotes) next to each other are automatically concatenated.
```
>>> 'Py' 'thon'
'Python'
```
