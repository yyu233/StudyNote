The basic problem being addressed is one of dependencies and versions, and indirectly permissions. Imagine you have an application that needs version 1 of LibFoo, but another application requires version 2. How can you use both these libraries? If you install everything into your host python (e.g. python3.8) it’s easy to end up in a situation where two packages have conflicting requirements.

Or more generally, what if you want to install an application and leave it be? If an application works, any change in its libraries or the versions of those libraries can break the application. Also, what if you can’t install packages into the global site-packages directory, due to not having permissions to change the host python environment?
