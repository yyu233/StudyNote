    A shallow copy constructs a new compound object and then (to the extent possible) inserts references into it to the objects found in the original.

    A deep copy constructs a new compound object and then, recursively, inserts copies into it of the objects found in the original.

Two problems often exist with deep copy operations that donâ€™t exist with shallow copy operations:

    Recursive objects (compound objects that, directly or indirectly, contain a reference to themselves) may cause a recursive loop.

    Because deep copy copies everything it may copy too much, such as data which is intended to be shared between copies.
