## The Advantage of Interpreted Language ## 
Python is an interpreted language, which can save you considerable time during program development because **no compilation and linking is necessary**.The interpreter can be used interactively, which makes it easy to experiment with features of the language, to write **throw-away programs**, or to test functions during bottom-up program development.
