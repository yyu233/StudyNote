There are two Linux C/C++ library types that can be created. Those are Static libraries (.a) and Dynamically linked shard object libraries (.so)

When it comes to (.so), there is only one form of this library but it can be used in two ways.

1) Dynamically linked at run time but statically aware. The libraries must be available during compile/link phase. The shared objects are not included into the executable component but are tied to the execution.

2) Dynamically loaded/unloaded and linked during execution (i.e. browser plug-in) using the dynamic linking loader system functions.

Normally package files will place ".so" files in /lib or /usr/lib when installing.
