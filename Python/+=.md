a += 1  
Since ints are immutable, what happens here is as follows:

1. look up the object that a refers to (it is an int with id 0x559239eeb380)
2. look up the value of object 0x559239eeb380 (it is 1)
3. add 1 to that value (1 + 1 = 2)
4. create a new int object with value 2 (it has object id 0x559239eeb3a0)
5. rebind the name a to this new object
6. Now a refers to object 0x559239eeb3a0 and the original object (0x559239eeb380) is no longer refered to by the name a. If there aren't any other names refering to the original object it will be garbage collected later.
