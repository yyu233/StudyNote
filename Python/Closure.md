```
def print_msg(msg):
# This is the outer enclosing function

    def printer():
# This is the nested function
        print(msg)

    return printer  # this got changed

# Now let's try calling this function.
# Output: Hello
another = print_msg("Hello")
another()
```

The print_msg() function was called with the string "Hello" and the returned function was bound to the name another. On calling another(), the message was still remembered although we had already finished executing the print_msg() function.

This technique by which some data ("Hello") gets attached to the code is called closure in Python.

This value in the enclosing scope is remembered even when the variable goes out of scope or the function itself is removed from the current namespace.

The criteria that must be met to create closure in Python are summarized in the following points.

We must have a nested function (function inside a function).
The nested function must refer to a value defined in the enclosing function.
The enclosing function must return the nested function.

Closures can avoid the use of global values and provides some form of data hiding. It can also provide an object oriented solution to the problem.

When there are few methods (one method in most cases) to be implemented in a class, closures can provide an alternate and more elegant solutions. But when the number of attributes and methods get larger, better implement a class.
