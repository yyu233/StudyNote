Platform-as-a-service (PaaS) is a type of cloud computing offering in which a service provider delivers a platform to clients, enabling them to develop, run, and manage business applications without the need to build and maintain the infrastructure such software development processes typically require.

FaaS is a type of serverless offering that allows companies to develop and run discrete, event-driven functions without the complexity of building and maintaining the infrastructure typically needed for developing and launching an application.

PaaS and serverless computing services typically charge only for compute, storage, and network resources consumed. FaaS takes that approach to the extreme, charging only when functions are executed, making FaaS a natural choice for intermittent tasks.
