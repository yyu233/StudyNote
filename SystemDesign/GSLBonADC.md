GSLB based on Application Delivery Controller (ADC): traditional load-balancers and ADCs see all traffic from the client to the servers hosting the application, they are in-line, thus have a real-time view of the application availability and performance from a network standpoint. When using multiple ADCs on different datacenters to serve the same application, the ADCs can set up specific communication for exchanging statistics on the servers hosting the application. GSLB can be enabled on such clustered-ADC infrastructures as soon as the DNS zone containing the application FQDN is managed by the ADC service. Standard distribution scenarios are based on round robin and availability. Some topology mapping can also been introduced in order to direct specific client subnets to a preferred datacenter. In more advanced scenarios, the redirect of the client traffic can be performed based on the delay calculated by the network during the first step of the communication with the ADC, or a specific monitoring protocol can be established towards the client (e.g. ICMP).
