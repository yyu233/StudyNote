Amazon S3 operations work on the entire items. It is not possible to run atomic batch operations on object groups, and it’s hard to work only on parts of a particular object. However, there are restrictions to this, like retrieving byte ranges from an object, but it’s not easy to append content to a single object from many sources concurrently. 

DynamoDB works on structured documents, hence, its smallest atom of operation is the property inside an item. You can also store binary unstructured information in DynamoDB, but that is not its core use case. Multiple users can modify the properties of a structured document at the same time, or append to the same array. DynamoDB can handle conditional updates and batch operations, even atomic transactions on many items.
