Amazon S3 was designed for throughput, not predictable latency. It can handle an extremely high number of traffic requests, especially requests for different items. 

On the other hand, DynamoDB was designed for sustained usage patterns and low latency. For relatively small items, especially those with a size of less than 4 KB, DynamoDB runs individual operations faster than Amazon S3.DynamoDB can scale on-demand, but S3 offers better scalability. In case of huge volumes of traffic, DynamoDB can be overwhelmed for a while.
