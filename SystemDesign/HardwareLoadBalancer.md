Hardware load balancers are highly performant physical hardware. They sit in front of the application servers and distribute the load based on the number of existing open connections to a server, compute utilization, and several other parameters.

Since these load balancers are physical hardware they need maintenance and regular updates, just like any other server hardware would need. They are expensive to set up in comparison to software load balancers, and their upkeep may require a certain skill set.

If the business has an IT team and network specialists in house, they can take care of these load balancers. Otherwise, the developers are expected to wrap their heads around how to set up these hardware load balancers with some assistance from vendors. This is why developers prefer working with software load balancers
