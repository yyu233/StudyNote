Amazon S3 is an object store good for the storage of large binary unstructured data. It can store objects of up to 5 TB in size. S3 groups the objects into buckets. See a bucket as a database table or a namespace or a disk drive. Each S3 bucket is associated with a region. It is easy to set up cross-region replication for quick local access and backups. It is difficult to set up multi-master replication in Amazon S3. The architecture of Amazon S3 is shown below.
