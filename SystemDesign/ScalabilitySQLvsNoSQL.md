Well, one big limitation with SQL based relational databases is scalability. Scaling relational databases is not trivial. They have to be Sharded or Replicated to make them run smoothly on a cluster. In short, this requires careful thought and human intervention.

On the contrary, NoSQL databases have the ability to add new server nodes on the fly and continue the work without any human intervention, just with a snap of your fingers.

Todayâ€™s websites need fast read-writes. There are millions, if not billions of users connected with each other on social networks.

A massive amount of data is generated every microsecond, and we needed an infrastructure designed to manage this exponential growth.
