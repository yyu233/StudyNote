Software load balancers can be installed on commodity hardware and VMs. They are more cost-effective and offer more flexibility to the developers. Software load balancers can be upgraded and provisioned easily compared to hardware load balancers.

You will also find several Load Balancers as a Service (LBaaS) services online that enable you to directly plug in load balancers into your application without you having to do any sort of setup.

Software load balancers are pretty advanced compared to DNS load balancing as they consider many parameters such as content hosted by the servers, cookies, HTTP headers, CPU and memory utilization, load on the network, and so on to route traffic across the servers.

They also continually perform health checks on the servers to keep an updated list of in-service machines.

Development teams prefer to work with software load balancers as hardware load balancers require specialists to manage them.

HAProxy is one example of a software load balancer that is used widely by the big guns in the industry to scale their systems, including GitHub, Reddit, Instagram, AWS, Tumblr, StackOverflow, and many more.
