Service-based architectures are often designed to be request-driven, in which services send commands to other services to tell them what to do, await a response, or send queries to get the resulting state. Building services on a protocol of requests and responses forces a complicated web of synchronous dependencies that bind services together.

In contrast, in an event-driven design, the event stream is the inter-service communication that enables services to cross deployment boundaries and avoids synchronous execution. When and how downstream services respond to those events is within their control, which reduces the coupling between services and enables an architecture with more pluggability.
