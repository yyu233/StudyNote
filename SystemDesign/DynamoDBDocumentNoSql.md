DynamoDB is a document or NoSQL database. Although it can be used for the storage of binary objects, it was designed for the storage of structured textual/JSON data. It can store individual items of up to 400 KB in size. The items are stored in tables, which can be located in a particular region or replicated globally. The global tables support multi-master replication, allowing clients to write into the same item or table from multiple regions
